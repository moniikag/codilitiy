# codility 100%
# A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given.
# The consecutive elements of array A represent consecutive cars on a road.
# Array A contains only 0s and/or 1s:
# 0 represents a car traveling east,
# 1 represents a car traveling west.
# The goal is to count passing cars.
# The function should return âˆ’1 if the number of pairs of passing cars exceeds 1,000,000,000.
